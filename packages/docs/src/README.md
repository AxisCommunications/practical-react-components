# Practical react components

A catalogue of React components, focused on ease-of-use.

To install the core package, run:

```shell
yarn add practical-react-components-core
```

This contains all the core components. All the icons are located in a separate
[practical-react-components-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/practical-react-components-icons) package.

## Dependencies

Practical react components is dependent on some packages, in addition to `react`
and `react-dom`, that need to be installed for it to work. Make sure the
following packages are installed:

```shell
yarn add styled-components
yarn add react-transition-group
yarn add pepjs
```

If you are using [practical-react-components-formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/practical-react-components-formik) you also need to make sure
the following packages are installed:

```shell
yarn add formik
```

### Typescript

Install additional typings:

```shell
yarn add @types/styled-components
```

If you use Typescript and want to use `styled-components`, you need to add a
file to your source directory, e.g.:

```shell
styled-components.d.ts
```

with the following contents:

```typescript
import 'styled-components'
import { Theme } from './theme'

declare module 'styled-components' {
  export interface DefaultTheme extends Theme {}
}
```

in which case you should get proper typings for the `theme` prop in your own
styled components.

Make sure this file is included in your `tsconfig.json` files, e.g.
`"include": ["src/styled-components.d.ts", "./src/index.ts"]`.

### Electron

If you are using Practical react components with an Electron app you might have
to add the following lines in the root of you `package.json` file.

```json
"electronWebpack": {
  "whiteListedModules": [
    "practical-react-components-core",
    "styled-components"
  ]
}
```

## Usage

Practical react components makes use of contexts to provide theme and toast
creators. To make it possible to use the components, you need to wrap your app
in a `PracticalProvider`.

On the provider you can optionally specify a theme and behaviors for toasts.

```typescript
export const Entry: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <PracticalProvider>
      <App />
    </PracticalProvider>
  )
}
```

In your app, you can then start using Practical react components:

```typescript
export const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState()
  const { showSuccessToast } = useToasts()

  return (
    <AppContainer>
      <TextInput onValueChange={setText} />
      <SpaceBlock variant={16} />
      <Button
        label="Yay"
        onClick={() => showSuccessToast({ label: `You wrote: ${text}` })}
      />
    </AppContainer>
  )
}
```
