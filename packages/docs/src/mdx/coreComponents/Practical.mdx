# PracticalProvider

PracticalProvider is a wrapper component that is necessary to use Practical react components components
in an application. It is used to set the theme and configuration of toasts, such
as duration.

It contains several layers and each layer creates a new div element which is
rendered as a sibling to the previous layer and a child of the practical root.

Other components can access the layer element and id
through the LayerContext.

Layers cannot be clicked, but all children of it
can be clicked on.

## Basic usage

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import {
  GlobalScrollbarStyle,
  PracticalProvider,
} from 'practical-react-components-core'

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [theme] = useTheme()

  if (theme === undefined) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <PracticalProvider
      theme={theme}
      toastsOptions={{
        placement: {
          justify: 'center',
          top: '0',
        },
        alwaysOnTop: false,
        defaultDurations: {
          success: 4000,
        },
      }}
    >
      <GlobalScrollbarStyle />
      <MyApp />
    </PracticalProvider>
  )
}
```
