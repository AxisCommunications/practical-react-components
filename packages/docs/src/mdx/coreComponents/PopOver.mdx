# PopOver

A `PopOver` component is used to render an element relative to another (an anchor),
but outside of the DOM tree of the anchor. This way, the rendered element
can escape the parent anchor.

This component is intended as a base for other components such as e.g. `Menu` or `Tooltip`.

The `PopOver` component is rendered with `position: fixed;` and it does not follow
the anchor around in case it would move. This is intentional to keep the component
as simple as possible (i.e. only computing position on render, not tracking the anchor).
Therefore, in e.g. `Menu`, the `PopOver` itself is hidden whenever any parent is scrolled.

## Example usage

```typescript type="code"
import { useState } from 'react'

const MyPopOver = () => {
  const [anchorEl, setAnchorEl] = useState(null)
  return (
    <div ref={setAnchorEl}>
      <PopOver anchorEl={anchorEl}>
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'pink' }}>
          <Typography>{'Hello'}</Typography>
        </div>
      </PopOver>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Props

PopOver forwards all unknown props to the base native `<div>` component. See
[`<div>` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) for more
details on which additional props that are available.
